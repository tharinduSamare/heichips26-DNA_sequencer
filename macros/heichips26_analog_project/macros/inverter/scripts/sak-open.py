"""One button per design file; click it and the right tool opens it.

    sak-open.py [root] [options]

Scans the tree for the extensions below and puts up a window with one button per
file, labelled with the file name and grouped by directory. Pressing a button
launches

    .sch .sym                        xschem
    .gds .gds.gz .oas .oas.gz        klayout -e        (edit mode)
    .mag                             magic
    .vcd .fst .gtkw                  gtkwave
    .raw                             gaw               (ngspice rawfile)
    .png .pdf                        xdg-open          (the desktop's handler)
    everything textual               gvim              (RTL, SPICE decks, flow
                                                       collateral, Makefiles,
                                                       scripts, prose)

in the file's own directory, so xschem finds its `simulations/` and klayout its
run outputs where they belong. It needs a display, so run it in the VNC/noVNC
desktop or over X11 forwarding, not in a shell-only container.

Schematics and symbols of one design unit share a single tabbed xschem
instance rather than getting one process per click, remote-controlled through
xschem's TCP interface. The unit is found from the clicked file's directory:
without an xschemrc the directory stands alone, with one the nearest ancestor
holding a Makefile (the macro root in the IIC design templates) is the unit,
and when no such ancestor exists up to a .git boundary or `$DESIGNS`, the
xschemrc's directory is. Directories grouped this way should pin netlist_dir
in their xschemrc files, so every tab writes its simulations to one agreed
place. `SAK_OPEN_GROUP_MARKERS` replaces the Makefile marker with a
comma-separated list of file names, `SAK_OPEN_NO_GROUP=1` turns the sharing
off entirely.

Without an argument it scans `$DESIGNS`, falling back to the current directory
when that is unset.

Hovering a button reports the file's size and age in the status line, plus a
marker when it is a symlink or not writable. Clicking a directory heading folds
it away. The right mouse button opens a menu:

    Cell view       every view of one cell -- `gate.sch`, `gate.sym`,
                    `gate.gds`, `gate.nl.v` -- wherever in the tree they live,
                    and whether or not their type is ticked. Right-click any of
                    them and untick it to get the whole tree back.
    Scope here      rescan from the clicked file's directory, which is how a
                    tree too big for `--max` becomes workable. "Back to full
                    tree" returns to the root the program started with.
    Save view       remember the folded directories and the ticked types for
                    this tree in ~/.config/sak-open.json (XDG_CONFIG_HOME is
                    honoured), and "Restore view" puts them back.
    Open shell      a terminal in the file's directory.
    Copy path       the path on the clipboard, absolute or root-relative.

The tree is rescanned every 15 s (`--refresh`), so a file a flow run or a save
creates appears on its own; the window is only rebuilt when the list actually
changed, and keeps its scroll position when it is. Anything that appeared or
was rewritten since the last scan is shown in bold for a minute, which makes a
running flow visible as it lands.

Build outputs are skipped by default -- a LibreLane `runs/` tree alone can hold
ten times more GDS than the design does. `--all` walks everything, `--prune
NAME` adds a directory name to the skip list.

At most `--max` buttons (400) are drawn at once, because each one is an X
window and an X server refuses to allocate a few hundred more. What is left
out is stated at the end of the list and in the status line; narrowing the
filter or unticking a few types brings it into view.

Each viewer command can be overridden from the environment, e.g.

    SAK_OPEN_SV='code -w' sak-open.py

The same file types are wired into the desktop's MIME database, so double
clicking one in Thunar opens the same tool (see
`skel/usr/share/mime/packages/iic-osic-tools-types.xml` and
`skel/usr/share/applications/mimeapps.list` in the image sources).
